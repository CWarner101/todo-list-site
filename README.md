# TODO Application
This is a project that I worked on for a class about web applications and Django
## Author

## Description

This is a Django Web Application with a single model to hold TODOs and a single home/index page that will list out all of the TODOs that have been entered via the admin. The home page extends off of a base template even though there is only one page.

The main non-admin page will be a list of all the TODOs and the date that they should be completed by. Additionally, there are buttons (as links) for add, edit, and delete that will take the user to the corresponding admin page for that functionality. You can see a screenshot of what I am expecting below in the screenshots section.

Tests for the site ensure that it exists at the correct URLs and the content for the page exists.


The TODO model contains the following fields:
* Name
* Complete By
